    <p><h1>LIBRARY FACILITIES | GIM FACILITIES | SPORTS | SWIMMING POOL</h1>
      The university is known to have a long tradition of alumni who now occupy important political and bureaucratic positions (see Prominent alumni). This is in part due to the strong prevalence of Left-Centric student politics and the existence of a written constitution for the university to which noted Communist Party leader Prakash Karat contributed exhaustively during his education at KTU. However, on 24 October 2008 the Supreme Court of India stayed the KTU elections and banned the KTUSU for not complying with the recommendations of the Lyngdoh committee. After a prolonged struggle and multi-party negotiations, the ban was lifted on 8 December 2011. After a gap of more than four years, interim elections were scheduled again on 1 March 2012. Following the election results declared on 3 March 2012, AISA candidates won all four central panel seats and Sucheta De, the president of AISA became the president of KTUSU.
